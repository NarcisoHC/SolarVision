SolarVision is the final project for our data science bootcamp at le wagon. The idea was to create a tool that enables the user to get satellite footage of a certain area of a city and find all rooftops with and without solar panels to get information about what potential area there is to install further photovoltaic. 

What we have build in just two weeks is a web application that allows you to upload rooftop photos directly and that uses a CNN model trained on several thousand pictures to verify if those photos show a rooftop with a solar panel or not. If a solar panel is detected is also uses a second pretrained model (based on the MobileNetV2 model from tensorflow) to find the position of the solar panel in the picture and use that for a rough estimation of the area of the solar panel. A second functionality we implemented was to use the open API for [mapbox.com](http://mapbox.com) to enter an address and automatically retrieve satellite footage of the building at and around that adress to see if there are solar panels to be detected in that area.

The Frontend of the app is build with streamlit and hosted on Heruko. the backend is accessed via an API we built that is deployed from a docker container on Google Cloud Run.
